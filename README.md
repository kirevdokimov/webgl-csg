# webgl-csg
Constructive Solid Geometry example in WebGL

Triangulation process to make csg polygons compatible to webgl buffers is included

```
npm i 
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Solution with strictly no bundler, so [csg.js](https://github.com/evanw/csg.js/) and [glMatrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) are both included as sources.
